10996-Hybrid Cloud and Datacenter Monitoring with Operations Management Suite (OMS)
===================================================================================

What are we doing? - To support course 10996 Hybrid Cloud and Datacenter
Monitoring with Operations Management Suite (OMS), we will need to make frequent
updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in
the course. We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to
allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the
content current with changes in the Azure platform. - We hope that this brings a
sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure
changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an
enhancement right in the lab source. Help your fellow MCTs.

How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files? - The
instructor handbook and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source
for teaching the course content. - These files on GitHub are designed to be used
in conjunction with the student handbook, but are in GitHub as a central
repository so MCTs and course authors can have a shared source for the latest
lab files. - It is recommended that for every delivery of 10996, trainers check
GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure
services, and get the latest files for their delivery.

Note: It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials
and in turn, provide them separately to students. Pointing students directly to
GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to
access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing
experience for the student. An explanation to the student regarding why they are
receiving separate Lab instructions can highlight the nature of an
always-changing cloud-based interface and platform. Microsoft Learning support
for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is
limited to MCTs teaching this course only. GitHub should not be used to discuss
technical content in the course, or how to prep. It is specifically to address
changes in the labs. -To address general comments about the course & demos or
how to prepare for 10996, please use the MCT forums at
https://borntolearn.mslearn.net/mct/general/f/225. This is the MCT Readiness
forum for discussions, news, etc. to help you prepare to teach courses and let
you collaborate with other instructors.

Notes about the Demos in the course - In order to avoid discrepancies due to
interface changes (since we cannot update demos the same way we update labs,)
the demos intentionally do not provide step by step instructions. To fully
prepare, we encourage the Instructor to familiarize themselves completely with
the demos and content prior to teaching the course, and reach out to the MCT
forums for guidance and to online Azure technical resources such as the
Microsoft Azure forum on MSDN https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure for
technical questions.

What about changes to the student handbook? - We will review the student
handbook (including demos) on a quarterly basis and update through the normal
MOC release channels as needed.

Refer to the 10996AGitHubUserGuideforMCTs.pdf file on the Download Center for
detailed instructions for using GitHub. This document is also available on the
GitHub repo as 10996AGitHubUserGuideforMCTs.md.

Note: After you download the latest lab files from GitHub and copy them to the
student computers, ensure that the student computer is restarted before students
start the labs. This ensures that any PowerShell modules that have previously
been run will be replaced in memory by the latest versions. In addition, since
the scripts on GitHub are not codesigned, students need to run the following
command to ensure that the scripts will run: Set-ExecutionPolicy
–ExecutionPolicy Bypass –Force This command should be run at the beginning of
the class, and applied to the VM image if possible.
